# Bollywood_Movies_Analysis_Project
This repository contains all the Information about the Project Bollywood Movies Analysis. This project is made using Neo4j Graph Database.
Graph databases are different from regular databases in that they focus on connecting different pieces of information. This means that the database can remember the connections between different pieces of data, which makes it much faster when you want to look up information about a particular subject. There are many different graph databases out there, but Neo4j is the leader. It's easy to use and scales well, and its Cypher language is simple to understand. The Graph Data Science Library also has a lot of powerful graph manipulation and machine learning capabilities. I analyzed Bollywood movies using Neo4j to figure out which relationships exist between different pieces of information. This will be a difficult task because of the large amount of data involved, but Neo4j is a good choice because it can handle complex relationships easily. The data has been inserted into the Neo4j database and subsequently, relationships between actors, movies, and directors nodes have been analyzed.
